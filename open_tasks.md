- Implicit return nil type is interesting, how to know if all code paths return?
  - requiring a return runs into the same issue
  - unless you require a return in the outer scope which is easy but dumb
- ternary typing is wrong
- array upvalue capturing is probably fucked but idk if we really want to capture stack arrays anyway
- pool opcodes long and short versions
- **casts**
- expressions in array initializers (vlas)
