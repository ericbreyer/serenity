- Implicit return nil type is interesting, how to know if all code paths return?
  - requiring a return runs into the same issue
  - unless you require a return in the outer scope which is easy but dumb
- constants, constant pass?
- don't allow top level scripts (main function)
  - requires a notion of constexprs (and optimization pass?)
    - parse
    - type-check
    - optimize
    - emit bytecode
- Modules
